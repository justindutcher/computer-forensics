Digital Forensics for Corporations & Businesses

Whether it is dealing with disgruntled employees, theft of trade secrets or stolen intellectual property, companies turn to Digital Forensics Corporation (DFC) to investigate the digital activities of their employees, vendors and competitors.

DFC partners with companies to handle all their digital forensic needs, providing specialized technology, expertise and best practices in resolving critical business issues and helping organizations focus on their core concerns.

Many workplace disputes can be resolved quickly and have minimum impact, due to the incontrovertible evidence that can often be extracted from digital devices.

Even intentionally deleted files and data can be recovered from employees' cell phones, laptops and tablets or from company servers. In many cases, recovered metadata from such devices can establish a clear timeline of activities helping to identify timing, location, and the nature of actions occurred.

Our Forensic Reports are admissible in a court of law, usable for internal disciplinary hearings and provide data for internal incident reports.
